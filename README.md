# GAN-project
Gan is a research based project  to autonomously generate new architectural design imagery in the style of Zaha Hadid To do this, a W-GAN algorithm has been trained. It is a powerful algorithm to learn then recreate the unique patterns, styles, and geometries inherent in 2000 images of her original work


The number of original images collected was very small for the training process, so we had to use data processing algorithms to increase the number of training samples by applying Data Augmentation techniques
